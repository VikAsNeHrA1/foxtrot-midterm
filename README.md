This is my HTML/CSS portfolio website that uses a responsive grid system from Bootstrap to create columns for the image and text in the about section and the cards in the services section. The Font Awesome icons are added using the "fas" class and the appropriate icon class. The CSS file linked in the head section can be used to customize the styling of the website.
